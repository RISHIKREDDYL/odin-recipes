        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the basmati rice under running water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until golden brown and caramelized. Remove half of the caramelized onions and set them aside for garnishing.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger paste and garlic paste to the pot and saut√© for a minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces to the pot and cook until they are browned on all sides.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the yogurt, biryani masala powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Pour this mixture over the chicken in the pot.</li>
            <li>Add the cumin seeds, green cardamom pods, cloves, and cinnamon stick to the pot. Stir everything together to coat the chicken evenly with the spice mixture.</li>
            <li>Add the soaked and drained basmati rice to the pot, spreading it evenly over the chicken.</li>
            <li>Add enough water to the pot to cover the rice by about an inch. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for about 20-25 minutes or until the rice is cooked and tender.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for another 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Fluff the rice gently with a fork to separate the grains. Garnish with the reserved caramelized onions and fresh cilantro leaves.</li>
            <li>Serve the Chicken Biryani hot and enjoy the aromatic and flavorful combination of tender chicken and fragrant rice.</li>

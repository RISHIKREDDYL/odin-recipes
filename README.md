# Recipe Website Project

This project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, aimed at creating a recipe website using HTML. It's a fun assignment that allows you to showcase your skills in web development while exploring the world of delicious recipes. 

The website is designed to display various recipes and can be expanded and improved in the future. As you progress through the curriculum, you'll have the opportunity to enhance the website with additional features, styling, and functionality.

Feel free to explore the provided recipes and get inspired to try them out in your own kitchen. This project is a great way to practice HTML and embark on your culinary journey. Happy cooking!
